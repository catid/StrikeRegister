/**
    SimpleCipher is a symmetric AEAD scheme based on XOR and the t1ha fast hash.

    Goals:
    + Allow for it to be disabled by passing key = 0 to trace packets if needed.
    + Obfuscate data and frustrate reverse-engineering.
    + Should look like real encryption (no obvious patterns in encrypted data).
    + Prevent attempts to modify packet data.
    + Prevent attempts to inject packets.
    + Prevent attempts to replay packets; provided by StrikeRegister.
    + Run very fast - Should not show up on a profiler.

    Non-goals:
    + The cipher does not provide data security.

    Encryption:

    To encrypt or decrypt a datagram, a 16 byte value Adder is constructed based
    on the datagram sequence.  A 16 byte Key is initialized to the expanded key.
    For each 16 bytes, Adder is added into the Key, and then the sum is XOR'd
    into the datagram message payload.  This ensures that there are no patterns
    visible in the data even if the plaintext is all zeros.

    Since the encryption will change for each datagram, it will not be possible
    to see if two datagrams contain the same data by passively observing, which
    denies a game cheater the option of selectively dropping duplicate packets.

    Tagging:

    Each datagram is tagged with a 16-bit hash of its data.  This tagging allows
    the receiver to authenticate that the datagram was sent by its peer.
    Authentication is done by recalculating the hash and verifying it matches.

    The authors surveyed hash algorithms and selected t1ha() as being especially
    fast, satisfying the speed goal.  Compared to cryptographic hash functions:
    + t1ha() is 25-60x faster than HighwayHash.
    + HighwayHash is 2x faster than SipHash.

    The hash includes the connection key and the datagram sequence, so that two
    identical datagrams from the same connection will have a minimal chance of
    being tagged with the same hash.  Furthermore, two identical datagrams
    from different connections with the same sequence will also have different
    looking hashes.  As a result, it is not possible to replay datagrams from
    the current or previous connections.

    Discussion:

    The encryption mainly serves to hide the message content from tools that
    can observe datagram contents, inject, and modify, but have no knowledge
    of the custom protocol.  This makes it much harder to attack the netcode,
    as the attacker would have to reverse-engineer the software.

    Tag validation can serve as another guard against accepting packets
    accidentally from previous or parallel connections that originate from
    the same host address.
