/**
    This class implements anti-replay protection and compression for nonces.

    Replay refers to tampering where datagrams are replayed.  The receiver must
    keep a record of datagrams it has received in order to avoid accepting the
    same datagram twice.  It is designed for nonce sequence numbers that start
    at 0 and increment by 1 for each datagram (reliable or unreliable).

    IsDuplicate() checks incoming datagram nonces to see if they have already
    been seen.  Accept() will slide the window as needed and strike the nonce.

    This implementation of sliding window anti-replay protection avoids actually
    shifting the bitfield window as an optimization.  Instead WindowBitRotation
    is incremented in place of a shift.

    StrikeRegister will also decompress incoming nonce values from 1-7 bytes
    back to the original 8 byte (64-bit) sequence number based on recent values.
